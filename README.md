# Graph Theoretic GA for Clustering Data

## Overview
TBD

## Usage
The current implementaton is built for MATLAB R2017A. Non-standard MATLAB functions are included as part of core Hybrid GA (inclduing Louvain Method, Modularity calculation, and Adjusted Rand Index calculation).

An example using Fisher's Iris Data is included in 'example.mat'
